# SimpleAgent UI - Based on OpenAI React Chat

This project is a fork of the fantastic [OpenAI React Chat Web Application](https://github.com/elebitzero/openai-react-chat) created by **elebitzero**. The original project provides a clean, customizable web frontend for the OpenAI Chat API, built with React, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.

I’m integrating this UI as part of **SimpleAgent**, a project that explores the latest agentic best practices. The goal is to experiment with multi-agent systems and AI workflows in an intuitive, familiar interface. This UI was a perfect fit due to its clean design and robust structure.

## 🚀 Features
- Modern web stack: **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript**
- Customizable chat interface with multi-model support
- Designed for seamless integration with OpenAI APIs

See [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) for more details.
